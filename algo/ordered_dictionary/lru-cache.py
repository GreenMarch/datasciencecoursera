Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.

Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

Example:

LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4


Approach 1: Ordered dictionary
Intuition

We're asked to implement the structure which provides the following operations in \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) time :

Get the key / Check if the key exists

Put the key

Delete the first added key

The first two operations in \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) time are provided by the standard hashmap, and the last one - by linked list.

There is a structure called ordered dictionary, it combines behind both hashmap and linked list. In Python this structure is called OrderedDict and in Java LinkedHashMap.
